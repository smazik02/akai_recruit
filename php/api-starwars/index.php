// This task does require Composer. You can add more libraries if you want to.
// We suggest using Guzzle for requests (http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/)
// Remember to composer install
// The script will be outputting to a web browser, so use HTML for formatting

// When making different kinds of applications, data is often needed that we don't yet have.
// Many 3rd party providers offer APIs (wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)
// that can be consumed to find data we need.

// Your task is to use the The Star Wars API (https://swapi.co/) and it's docs (https://swapi.co/documentation)
// Display all starships provided through the API, with their properties
// Each ship should have the names of pilots and names of films displayed (if none, indicate)
// Each pilot should have its species also displayed
